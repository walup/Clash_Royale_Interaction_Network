# Clash_Royale_Interaction_Network
A tool I implemented to create a card interaction network based on pro player games.

All data is collected through the official clash royale API, which is documented here: https://developer.clashroyale.com

I provide now an example of the typp of networks that can be generated. Here the connections with higher opacity correspond to cases where the two cards appeared together a lot in decks used by the players considered for this particular analysis.
